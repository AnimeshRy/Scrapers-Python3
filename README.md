## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Important

Scraping itself maybe illegal for some people. This is made for educational purposes only and shouldn't be used for bad intent.
